    		<p><img src="img/nyu_0809.jpg" />I moved away from Seattle in the summer of 2008 to explore the East Coast and all that NYC had to offer. It was eminently worth it, but that doesn't mean it was easy. I am forever thankful for the community and camaraderie that I found among my floormates and my teammates. 7-South and Vurple Faze 4evr.</p>

You are constantly reminded to keep in mind responsibility, ethics, and that the world is bigger than just you, your company, or even your country. In 2010 &amp; 2011 I studied in the Cesky Republica, Espana, and Argentina.</p>

    		<p><img src="img/nyu_1112.jpg" />Accounting was never at the top of my list for majors, but you know what they say about the best-laid plans... After getting exposed to some of the more popular tracks like Economics and Finance, I realized that even though it wouldn't provide the sexiest degree, accounting came naturally and there was a certain OCD, nerdy pleasure in digging into financial statements and piecing together exactly how <em>this</em> money became <em>that</em> money.</p>
