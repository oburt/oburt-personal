		<p style="margin-top:12%;">In my spare time, I've been working on something entirely different: <span class="ultiworld">Ultiworld</span>, a professional news media website dedicated to ultimate. Three good friends and former teammates of mine, Charlie, Wes, and Dan, started the site in the <span class="time">summer of 2012</span> amongst the uproar over the first professional league suing one of their own franchises. They covered it better, more thoroughly, and more professionally than anyone else out there&mdash;and the effects of that coverage still reverberate today.</p>

For Ultiworld, I've taken on all things technical: <span class="skill">front-end</span>, back-end, you name it. That means "Hello again!" to <span class="skill">Wordpress</span>, <span class="skill">Amazon Web Services</span>, and <span class="skill">LAMP</span>.</p><p>So far, our crew is killing it, ad sponsors are a'knocking, and I can tell you there are exciting, big things in store.</p>
