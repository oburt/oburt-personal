		<p>In my spare time, I've been working on something entirely different: Ultiworld, a professional news media website dedicated to ultimate. Three good friends and former teammates of mine, Charlie, Wes, and Dan, started the site in the summer of 2012 amongst the uproar over the first professional league suing one of their own franchises. They covered it better, more thoroughly, and more professionally than anyone else out there&mdash;and the effects of that coverage still reverberate today.</p>

		<p>Working on an author-based, web-focused journalism business may be new to me, but it's refreshing and inspiring. For Ultiworld, I've taken on all things technical: front-end, back-end, you name it. That means "Hello again!" to Wordpress, Amazon Web Services, and LAMP.</p><p>So far, our crew is killing it, ad sponsors are a'knocking, and I can tell you there are exciting, big things in store.</p>
