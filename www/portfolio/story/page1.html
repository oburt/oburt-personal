		<p>I grew up playing soccer (13 years of it) and cycling (I've biked from Seattle to Portland in a weekend). I also come from a big family: three younger sisters, one older sister, and one older brother. I have four nieces and one nephew. And let's not get started on the aunts, uncles, and cousins. There's a lot of lessons from my childhood that I could share, but one stands out:</p><p>When we work together with people that we love, we can do amazing things. <br />And when that fails&mdash;well, at least we made some damn good memories.</p>
