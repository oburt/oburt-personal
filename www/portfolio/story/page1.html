		<p style="margin-top:80px;">I grew up playing <span class="skill">soccer</span> (13 years of it) and <span class="skill">cycling</span> (I've biked from Seattle to Portland in a weekend). I also come from a big family: three younger sisters, one older sister, and one older brother. I have four nieces and one nephew. And let's not get started on the aunts, uncles, and cousins. There's a lot of lessons from my childhood that I could share, but one stands out:</p><p>Work together with people you trust and you can do amazing things. <br />And if that fails&mdash;well, at least you made some damn good memories.</p>
