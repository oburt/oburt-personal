We had developed a way to use location check-ins and ratings to help you and your friends figure out new restaurants to visit. At that time, I was working extensively on <span class="skill">recommendation algorithms</span> and our <span class="skill">python &amp; C back-end</span>.</p>

		<p>Following a summer of user feedback and testing, we realized that when it comes to food, people trust people, not computers. Especially if those people are looking to share or discover "bite-sized restaurant reviews." Thus, we evolved into "Fondu &mdash; Dining Journal" in the <span class="time">fall of 2011</span>. We also closed a seed round of $575k.</p>

		<p>That summer was a whirlwind of new product design as we explored what frontiers Fondu could move on to next. Those winds of change turned into our acquisition by <span class="airbnb">Airbnb</span> (!) announced in the <span class="time">fall of 2012</span>. Most of the team joined Airbnb in SF to improve offline discovery on an entirely new &amp; awesome scale. I, however, still wanted to have a few more NYC adventures.</p>
