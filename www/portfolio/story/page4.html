		<p>I co-founded the company first known as enjoyn.me in January 2010. We saw the emerging power of social+local+mobile technologies (e.g. Facebook, Foursquare, and smartphones) and knew those things could help <em>bring people together in the real world.</em></p>

		<p>We launched "SpotOn &mdash; Rate. Share. Go." on-stage at TechCrunch Disrupt NYC 2011. We had developed a way to take location check-ins and ratings to help you and your friends figure out new restaurants to visit. At that time, I was deep into recommendation algorithms and back-end programming.</p>

		<p>Following a summer of user feedback and testing, we realized that when it comes to food, people trust people, not computers. Especially when those people are people they trust who have shared "bite-sized restaurant reviews" with them. Thus, we evolved into "Fondu &mdash; Dining Journal" in the fall of 2011. We also closed a seed round of $575k.</p>

		<p>With our shift away recommendation engines, my days became more often spent doing SEO, social media, event planning, product management, and measuring analytics.</p><p>By May of 2012, we had given out restaurant awards during SXSW and served free food-truck meals in Greenwish Village. Apple had featured us on the front page of the App Store as "New and Noteworthy" and then highlighted us as an example of excellent user interface design at WWDC.</p>

		<p>That summer was a whirlwind of new product design as we explored what frontiers Fondu could move on to next. This whirlwind transformed into our acquisition by Airbnb, announced in the fall of 2012. Most of the team joined Airbnb in SF to improve offline discovery on an entirely new &amp; awesome scale. I, however, still had room in my heart for a few more NYC adventures.</p>
