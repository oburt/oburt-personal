		<p>I co-founded the company formerly known as enjoyn.me in <span class="time">January of 2010</span>. We saw the emerging power of social+local+mobile technologies (e.g. Facebook, Foursquare, and smartphones) and knew those things could help <em>bring people together in the real world.</em></p>

		<p>We launched "SpotOn &mdash; Rate. Share. Go." on-stage at TechCrunch Disrupt NYC <span class="time">2011</span>. We had developed a way to take location check-ins and ratings to help you and your friends figure out new restaurants to visit. At that time, I was working extensively on <span class="skill">recommendation algorithms</span> and our <span class="skill">python &amp; C back-end</span>.</p>

		<p>Following a summer of user feedback and testing, we realized that when it comes to food, people trust people, not computers. Especially when those people are people they trust who have shared "bite-sized restaurant reviews" with them. Thus, we evolved into "Fondu &mdash; Dining Journal" in the <span class="time">fall of 2011</span>. We also closed a seed round of $575k.</p>

		<p>That summer was a whirlwind of new product design as we explored what frontiers Fondu could move on to next. This whirlwind transformed into our acquisition by <span class="airbnb">Airbnb</span> (!) announced in the <span class="time">fall of 2012</span>. Most of the team joined Airbnb in SF to improve offline discovery on an entirely new &amp; awesome scale. I, however, still wanted to have a few more NYC adventures.</p>
