		<p>In the fall of 2008, I uprooted myself and moved out to the biggest city of them all, New York. I came to NYU to study accounting at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business. And just so we're clear, accounting != bookkeeping. Accounting often is more accurately described as financial statement analysis, monetary forensics, or just "the language of business." As a degree basis for all-encompassing business knowledge and problem-solving, accounting is hard to beat.</p>

			<li>Want to know how your competitors are doing? Read their 10-K.</li>
			<li>Want to understand where your business' money is really going and coming from? Check the cashflow statement.</li>
			<li>Want to solve problems with real numbers and real ratios?</li>
			<li>Want to be well-versed in the language that all businesses and pusiness people understand and know all of the above? Accounting.</li>

		<p>While I attended NYU to study business, before I knew it, I had somehow already completed a minor in Computer Science. <br />At the end of my sophomore year.</p><p>I've been coding off &amp; on since I was nine years old and I guess once it's in your blood, you never really lose it. Thank god university finally taught me real object-oriented programming and proper data structures though.</p>
