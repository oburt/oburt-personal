		<p style="margin-top:2%;">In the <span class="time">fall of 2008</span>, I uprooted myself and moved out to the biggest city of them all, New York. I came to <span class="nyu">NYU</span> to study <span class="skill">accounting</span> at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business. And just so we're clear, accounting != bookkeeping. Accounting often is more accurately described as financial statement analysis, monetary forensics, or just "the language of business." As a degree basis for all-encompassing business knowledge and problem-solving, accounting is hard to beat.</p>

		<p>I've been coding off &amp; on since I was nine years old, but thank god university finally taught me real object-oriented programming and proper data structures. I guess once technology is in your blood though, you never really lose it (cyborg pun intended).</p>
