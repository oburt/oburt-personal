		<p style="margin-top:50px;">In the <span class="time">fall of 2008</span>, I uprooted myself and moved out to the biggest city of them all, New York. I came to <span class="nyu">NYU</span> to study <span class="skill">accounting</span> at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business. And just so we're clear, accounting does not just equal bookkeeping. I like to think of it more as financial statement analysis or monetary forensics.</p>
		<p>Somehow I also managed to complete a minor in <span class="skill">computer science</span> by the end of my sophomore year. I've been coding off &amp; on since I was nine years old, but thank god university finally taught me real object-oriented programming and proper data structures.</p>

		<p style="margin-top:130px;">I was fortunate enough to study abroad in Praha, Česká Republika, in the <span class="time">fall of 2010</span>. I certainly couldn't do it justice in a paragraph of words, but suffice it to say, Prague is the sort of place that has a way of charming and changing everyone who visits. As a popular Kafka quote reads, <em>"Prague never lets you go...this dear little mother has sharp claws."</em></p>
