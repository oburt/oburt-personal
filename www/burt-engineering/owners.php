								<span class="be-location">Seattle, WA</span> &mdash; We modernized and practically doubled the size of this house, using a wood framed seismic resistance system with a mostly new foundation system and engineered lumber to support the 2nd story.
							</p>
							<p>
								The site was underlain with poorly draining soil and had to be de-watered prior to construction.
							</p>
							<p>
								Burt Engineering also provides nonstructural design as needed to achieve specific seismic performance requirement as well as blast resistant design services as an extension of proper earthquake resistant design.

								<span class="be-location">Seattle, WA</span> &mdash; This is a new structure that is comprised of 5 buildings attached in a row. This building is built green. The trusses shown are site built from heavy timber, 50% of which was milled on site and the rest was from old growth lumber reclaimed from a 100 year old warehouse in Seattle.
							</p>
							<p>
								The trusses span 40 feet, supporting an 80 psf roof snow load. The trusses feature a clerestory, letting natural light in. The building includes a ranch maintenance shop, office space, and a small residence.

								The project also includes a wind turbine generator to reduce demand on the grid.
