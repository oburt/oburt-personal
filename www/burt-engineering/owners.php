							<h2>Seismic Evaluation and Analysis</h2>
							<h3>Tatwai House</h3>
							<p>
								We modernized and practically doubled the size of this house, using a wood framed seismic resistance system with a mostly new foundation system and engineered lumber to support the 2nd story.
							</p>
							<p>
								The site was underlain with poorly draining soil and had to be de-watered prior to construction.
							</p>
							<p>
								Burt Engineering also provides nonstructural design as needed to achieve specific seismic performance requirement as well as blast resistant design services as an extension of proper earthquake resistant design.

							<h2>Project Management</h2>
							<h3>Sammamish River Soil Retaining Structure</h3>
							<p>
								A retaining wall at the top of a steep slope environmentally critical area in above the Sammamish river valley in Woodinville. The wall was failing, sliding downward as the top of the slope was subsiding.
							</p>
							<p>
								Working closely with the geotechnical engineers at Nelson Geotechnical Associates, we designed a pressure grouted tie-back system to laterally anchor the wall above the global failure plane. The wall is supported horizontally by a waler and vertically by pipe piles. Equipment access was limited, so the design had to accommodate that challenge.

								Our project management services are offered to clients in need of assistance with a complex hazard mitigation program.
